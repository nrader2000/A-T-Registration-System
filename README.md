# A-T-Registration-System
This repo contains the A&amp;T Registration System project for my final project in COMP710

How to run
---
1. Clone the repo onto your machine
2. Either load the repo onto VSCode or the python CLI and navigate to the repo folder "flask-app"
3. Make sure you have at least python3(and pip)installed and have flask installed. To install flask simply without using and enviroment use the command `python -m pip install flask`
4. Once everything is setup, all you have to do to run this app using the command `python -m flask --app app run`
5. Go into your favorite browser and enter `localhost:5000` into the URL and the A&amp;T Registation System site should load.

Current Note
---
There is currently no way to get through the login portal by normal means so when you load up the webapp on your `localhost:5000` you can just change the URL to go to the homepage and navigate through the rest of the current framework for the software. (`localhost:5000/home`)
